<ul>
<li>
There are problems with copying/moving directories or files containing white spaces in their names. 
(Redmine issues: 402, 420. A future possible solution is to iterate over entires and handle/skip such exceptions manually.) 
</li>

<li>
Using SFTP sometimes "Unable to connect to server (caused by: verify: false)" exception is thrown. 
This comes from an underlying jsch sftp library (used by JSAGA), and there is no known real reason or workaround for this problem. 
(The new JSAGA version is based on another sftp implementation.)
